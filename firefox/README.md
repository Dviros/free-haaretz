# Free Haaretz (Firefox Edition)

A nefarious Firefox add-on that easily bypasses the Haaretz paywall.

If things aren't working as expected, make sure to reinstall (update) the add-on from time to time, to make sure you have the latest code.

(Looking for the [Chrome version](https://github.com/yuvadm/free-haaretz)?)

## Install

 1. Download the [add-on XPI file](https://github.com/yuvadm/free-haaretz-ff/raw/master/free-haaretz.xpi)

 2. Go to the `Tools > Add-ons` menu

 3. Click the âš™ button on the top

 4. Choose `Install Add-on From File`
