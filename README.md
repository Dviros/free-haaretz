# Free Haaretz

A nefarious Chrome extension that easily bypasses the haaretz.co.il paywall.

## Install

This extension can't be installed via the Google App Store since I couldn't care less about paying $5.00 and registering to work with it.

You can follow these steps to install manually:

 1. Download the [extension ZIP file](https://github.com/yuvadm/free-haaretz/archive/master.zip), also located on the right side bar.

 2. Unzip the file.

 3. In Google Chrome (or Chromium), in the address bar go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions)

 4. In the top right corner, click to enable **Developer Mode**.

 5. Click the **Load unpacked extension** button.

 6. Navigate to the folder you unziped your code to, and select it.

 7. The **FreeHaaretz** extension should now be loaded
